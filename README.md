Simplicity is a graphics library for C# with the goal of being as straightforward as possible. 
The library aims to minimize the lines of code required to draw 2D/3D objects on the screen.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still very much work in progress, therefore expect a lot of changes between versions, bugs and missing features

### Setup Instructions:
Download Simplicity.NET.dll and reference it in your project.
Download Simplicity.dll, add it to your project, and configure it to always copy to the output directory. Alternatively, drag it into the directory where your program's .exe file is located.
In the same directory as your .exe file, create a Shaders directory. Add at least one vertex shader (.vert) and one fragment shader (.frag). Example shaders can be found in the BasicWindow example.

### Usage:
Documentation is not yet available. Please refer to the BasicWindow example for guidance.
