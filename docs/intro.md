This project is still very much a work in progress, therefore expect a lot of changes between versions, bugs and missing features
:::

This documentation was made for version 0.3.0v

You can find examples of the library [here](https://github.com/Qzername/Simplicity/tree/main/Simplicity.NET/Examples)
